## ML Model to predict Euro 2024 Winner
### Process
After finishing my 1st year of CS and 1 day before the Euro 2024 Final, I wanted to challenge myself and do a 1 day project to predict the outcome of the match the following day.
First, I downloaded a public dataset with the scores of all the matches in euro 2024. 
After that I created a linear regression model to predict the winner of the game, and a separate logistic regression model to predict the actual score.
I used all the matches of England & Spain up until semi finals as training data, and semi finals as testing. I didn't expect a high accuracy level due to the small quantity of data (got ~70%).
Finally, the 2 models predicted the results.
   

### Final Prediction
**Spain** 2 : 0 **England**

Winner: **Spain**

### Real Result
**Spain** 2 : 1 **England**

Winner: **Spain**
